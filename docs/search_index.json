Mulder¹, Ellen Hamaker¹, &amp; Caspar J. van Lissa¹ ¹Utrecht University, Methodology &amp; Statistics Introduction These course materials are part of the Introduction to Structural Equation Modeling using Mplus (S20) and the Advanced Course on using Mplus (S23) courses. Both are five-day summer school courses hosted by Utrecht Universitys department of Methodology and Statistics. The main objective of the introductory course (S20) is to learn how to analyze several models with Mplus (e.g. path models, multiple group models, mediation and moderation, confirmatory factor analysis, and longitudinal models). More in-depth lectures on the fundamentals of Mplus and advanced longitudinal models are discussed in the advanced course (S23). Using the menu on the left, you can navigate to exercises of day 4 of S20 and S23. "],["s20-day-4.html", "S20 - Day 4", " S20 - Day 4 These exercises belong to day 4 of S20, ``Traits, Measurement Errors, and Time-Lags\". We are going to analyze the same data that were used in the Hamaker et al. (2015) paper and were presented in the lecture. The goals of these exercises are to get some experience with fitting (random intercept) cross-lagged panel models, interpreting their results, and comparing them. Here, we focus on the relationship between Parental Responsiveness and Adolescents Depressive Symptomatology (note, in the lecture the focus was on a different concept, namely Parental Psychological Control). The data (means, standard deviations, and the correlation matrix) are included in the file Soenens.dat. The number of observations is 396. The data command for these data should be: DATA: TYPE = MEANS STDEVIATIONS CORRELATION; FILE = Soenens.dat; NOBSERVATIONS = 396; The variable command should be: VARIABLE: NAMES = PsCon1-PsCon3 Res1-Res3 BeCon1-BeCon3 Dep1-Dep3; USEVARIABLES = Res1 Dep1 Res2 Dep2 Res3 Dep3; Do the exercises. You can navigate through them using the left-hand menu or the arrows on left- and right-hand side of this screen. Answers are included below each exercise. The Mplus input files can found in the Summer School Dropbox-folder (./Dropbox/Lab material - Day 4/S20 - Day 4 - 4MplusInputFiles). "],["the-mean-structure.html", "The mean-structure", " The mean-structure Exercise 1 Specify a model in which you investigate whether the group means can be constrained across time. Does this model fit? Tip: allow all variables to covary with each other (i.e. putting not constraints on the covariance structure) such that we are estimating means, and not intercepts. Click to show answers The model specification is given below. The model does not fit well, according to the \\(\\chi^{2}\\) and the RMSEA; CFI and TLI indicate a good and barely acceptable model fit, respectively. See the slides of day 1 of this summer school if you need a refresher on the recommended cutoff values for these fit indices (although such cutoff recommendations remain a hotly debated topic among statisticians). \\(\\chi^{2}\\) (4) = 19.620, \\(p &lt; .001\\) RMSEA = 0.099 CFI = 0.986 TLI = 0.946 Exercise 2 What can you do to improve the model fit? Click to show answers We can look at the modification indices in the output. Here, we specified MOD(4) in the OUTPUT command, which indicates all parameters that can be added/freed that will lead to a decrease in chi-square of at least 4 points (which is a significant improvement combined with 1 df). Based on the Mplus output, it appears that freeing the mean of Dep1 leads to the largest change in chi-square (M.I. = 10.53). Exercise 3 Run the adjusted model and discuss the results. Click to show answers Syntax for the adjusted model is in Means2.inp. Looking at the fit indices of the adjusted model, the chi-square for this model is still significant, but all other measures indicate the model fit is okay to excellent. Moreover, the model is a significant improvement in comparison to the previous model: \\(\\Delta\\chi^{2} = 19.62 - 8.71 = 10.91\\), with \\(\\Delta\\)df = 1 and, \\(p = .001\\). You can calculate the p-value of the \\(\\Delta \\chi^{2}\\) using the pchisq()-function in R (with the lower.tail argument set to FALSE), or an online tool "],["the-clpm.html", "The CLPM", " The CLPM Exercise 4 The cross-lagged panel model. Specify the CLPM in Mplus. Regress the observed variables directly on each other over time, as in the graph above. Try to think of where each parameter you estimate should go in the graph. Click to show answers The input for this models can be found in CLPM.inp. Exercise 5 Specify the model as in the graph below (the CLPM with centered latent variables), and again include the (significant) parameter estimates in this graph. Tip: do not forget to constrain the measurement error variances of the observed variables to 0. The cross-lagged panel model with centered latent variables. Click to show answers The input for this models can be found in CLPMalt.inp. Exercise 6 The two models should lead to the exact same model fit. Estimate the model and discuss the model fit. When comparing the parameter estimates, what is the difference between the model in question 4 and the model in question 5? Click to show answers Model 5 is, just like model 4, a traditional CLPM, but specified in such a way that the mean structure is first separated from the regression part of the model. This implies we model the means, rather than intercepts, which makes it easier to impose the constraint of identical means over time. So, the fit indices and most parameter estimates are equivalent, except for (see next question) Exercise 7 Which parameter estimates differ? How can they be related? Click to show answers The difference in parameter estimates is in the means/intercepts. For the first model we estimate the means at wave 1, and intercepts thereafter. For the second model we obtain mean estimates at each wave (although they are referred to as intercepts in the Mplus output). Again, the reason for this is that in the first model, the means at wave 2 and 3 are partly predicted by the means from previous waves (through the lagged relationships). Therefore, the constants that are estimated should be interpreted as intercepts. In the second model, the mean part (triangles) and the regression part (lagged parameters) are separated. Exercise 8 Constrain the means in the second version of the CLPM. Please do not constrain the mean of Dep1, however, as this constraint proved untenable in exercise 3. Discuss the model fit. Click to show answers The input for these models are in CLPMalt2.inp. The chi-square has increased in comparison with the previous model: The reason is that this is a restricted model (a special case of the previous model). We can test whether the increase in misfit is significant using the chi-square difference test: \\(\\Delta\\chi^{2} = 69.59 - 62.98 = 6.61\\) with \\(\\Delta\\)df = 7  4 = 3, \\(p = .0854\\). Hence, the constraints are tenable. We can also look at information criteria such as the AIC or BIC. The model with the lowest AIC or BIC is preferred. Exercise 9 Continue with the model from the previous question and constrain all the lagged parameters between wave 1 and 2 to be identical to the lagged parameters between wave 2 and 3. Discuss the model fit, and compare this model to the previous one to see whether the constraint holds. Click to show answers The input for these models are in CLPMalt3.inp. The chi-square has again increased in comparison with the previous model: The reason is that this is a restricted model (a special case of the previous model). We can test whether the increase in misfit is significant: \\(\\Delta\\chi^{2} 81.52 - 69.59 = 11.93\\), \\(\\Delta\\)(df) = 11 - 7 = 4, \\(p = .0178\\). If we stick to an alpha of .05, the constraints must be rejected (as the increase in misfit is significant). Note that we are doing several model comparisons here, so one could also argue that we should use a smaller alpha to guard against an inflated overall type I error. Again, an alternative would be to use information criteria for model comparisons. "],["the-ri-clpm.html", "The RI-CLPM", " The RI-CLPM Exercise 10 Specify the RI-CLPM for these data (without any constraints on the lagged parameters over time). Discuss the model fit. Click to show answers The input for these models are in RICLPM.inp. This model fits very well; however, it only has 1 df, so it is not doing much for data reduction. Exercise 11 Specify the RI-CLPM with the constraints on the grand means at each occasions. Again, please do not constrain the mean of Dep1, however, as this constraint proved untenable in exercise 3. Click to show answers The input for these models are in RICLPM2.inp. This model has an acceptable (RMSEA, \\(\\chi^{2}\\)) to good (CFI and TLI) fit. Comparing it to the previous model, we get a chi-square difference test of \\(\\Delta\\chi^{2} = 9.590 - 0.84 = 8.75\\), \\(\\Delta\\)df = 4 - 1 = 3, \\(p = .0328\\). This implies that the constraints we impose on the means are untenable (they lead to a significant worsening of model fit). You might therefore decide to ultimately not impose these constraints. However, for didactical reasons, we continue with these constraints in place in the next exercise. Exercise 12 Add the constraints on the lagged parameters to the previous model. Click to show answers The input for these models are in RICLPM3.inp. This model fits okay (depending on the measure). Comparing it to the previous model, we get \\(\\Delta\\chi^{2} = 19.74 - 9.59 = 8.15\\), \\(\\Delta\\)df = 8 - 4 = 4, \\(p = .0379\\). Again, this implies that constraining the lagged effects to be time-invariant is untenable (it leads to a significant worsening of model fit). Exercise 13 Compare all the models so far simultaneously, using the AIC and BIC. Which model is selected? Click to show answers Based on the AIC, the RI-CLPM without any constraints provides the closest fit to the data, followed by the two other RI-CLPMs (and the adjusted means model). Based on the BIC, the RI-CLPM with constraints on the means and the lagged parameters is superior to the other models.

The exercises consist roughly of 2 parts: first we will focus on the quasi-simplex model, and second we will focus on the random intercept cross-lagged panel model. For the quasi-simplex model we are going to study the concept of life satisfaction. The covariance matrix is in the file Coenders.dat and comes from 1724 children and adolescents that participated in the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being (NSCAW) in Russia. They indicated how satisfied they were with their lives as a whole on a 10-point scale (1 = not at all satisfied, 10 = very satisfied). There were three waves (1993, 1994 and 1995). At the third wave, the question was asked twice (with 40 minutes in between). Hence, in total there are four measurements obtained at three waves. The data and variables commands for these data should read: DATA: TYPE = COVARIANCE; FILE = Coenders.dat; NOBSERVATIONS = 1724; VARIABLE: NAMES = Y1 Y2 Y3 Y4; The researchers are interested in fitting a quasi-simplex model to these data, that is, a simplex model at the latent level, thus accounting for measurement error in the observations. This model is graphically represented in slide 19. Use the menu on the left to navigate to the exercises. The Mplus input files can found in the Summer School Dropbox-folder (./Dropbox/Lab material - Day 4/S23 - Day 4 - 4MplusInputFiles). "],["i-quasi-simplex-model.html", "I Quasi-simplex model", " I Quasi-simplex model Exercise A Provide the names of the variances (i.e., indicate in which model matrix, and which position in this matrix they have) in the quasi-simplex graph on slide 19. What is the difference between the \\(e\\)s and the \\(\\zeta\\)s? Click to show answers \\(e\\)s are residuals at the measurement level and can be found in the \\(\\theta\\)-matrix. They only influence the observation at a single occasion in time. \\(\\zeta\\)s are residuals of the simplex process and can be found in the \\(\\psi\\)-matrix. Their effect is carried forward to future observation through the autoregressive relationships. Exercise B How would you specify the model in Mplus? Click to show answers See the Mplus input file Exercise B.inp. Exercise C Determine the number of degrees of freedom for this model (indicate how you obtained this number). Is it possible to estimate this model? Click to show answers There are \\(\\frac{4 \\times 5}{2} = 10\\) unique elements in \\(S\\). Free parameters: 4 residual variances at measurement level 1 factor variance 3 residual factor variances 3 regression parameters 11 parameters in total. Therefore, we have \\(10 - 11 = -1\\) df. It is not possible to estimate this model because we are trying to estimate more parameters than we have information in the data. Exercise D To make sure a quasi-simplex model is identified, often the variances of the measurement errors are constrained to be equal over time. How can you do this in Mplus? How many df does this model have? Click to show answers See the Mplus input file Exercise E.inp for how to constrain the measurement error variances over time. With constrained measurment error variances, we estimate 3 parameters less. So, we estimate \\(11 - 3 = 8\\) and therefore have \\(10 - 8 = 2\\) df. Exercise E Run the model and report on the model fit. Click to show answers We find the below fit indices: \\(\\chi^{2}\\) = 13.29 with df = 2, \\(p = .0013\\), RMSEA = .057, CFI = .994, and TLI = .981. Except for \\(\\chi^{2}\\) test of model fit, the model seems to fit the data well. Note, however, that the sample size is very large and therefore the \\(\\chi^{2}\\) is likely to be significant, even for minor problems with model fit. Exercise F The quasi-simplex model you just ran, led to the following warning: WARNING: THE LATENT VARIABLE COVARIANCE MATRIX (PSI) IS NOT POSITIVE DEFINITE. THIS COULD INDICATE A NEGATIVE VARIANCE/RESIDUAL VARIANCE FOR A LATENT VARIABLE, A CORRELATION GREATER OR EQUAL TO ONE BETWEEN TWO LATENT VARIABLES, OR A LINEAR DEPENDENCY AMONG MORE THAN TWO LATENT VARIABLES. CHECK THE TECH4 OUTPUT FOR MORE INFORMATION. PROBLEM INVOLVING VARIABLE ETA4. What is the problem? Click to show answers In your output, look at the reported (estimated) residual variances. We find that the residual variance of ETA4 is estimated to be negative. This is a Heywood case and it is causing the warning to appear. Note however, that it is significant, so ``just\" fixing it to 0 as a solution is probably not warrented here. Exercise G As indicated in the description of the data, the third and fourth measurement were obtained at the same measurement wave (with only 40 minutes in between). Hence, the researchers proposed the following model instead of the regular quasi-simplex model. Explain why this model makes more sense for these data than the regular quasi-simplex model. Tip: check the description of the study at the beginning of this exercise. Adjusted quasi-simplex model. Click to show answers At each occasion there is a latent variable which represents Life Satisfaction. At the first two occasions there was only a single indicator of this latent variable, but at the third occasion there were two indicators. Exercise H How many df does this model have? Note that we keep the constraint on the variances of the measurement errors. Click to show answers There are \\(\\frac{4*5}{2} = 10\\) unique elements in S. We freely estimate: 1 constrained residual variances at measurement level 1 factor variance 2 residual factor variances 2 regression parameters 1 factor loading 7 parameters in total. Therefore, we have \\(10 - 7 = 3\\) df. Exercise I Are these two models nested? If so, how? If not, why not, and how could we compare them? Click to show answers Yes, they are nested: this model is a special case of the previous model, as it is based on having ETA3 and ETA4 from the previous model now being a single latent variable. That is, we can constrain the residual variance of ETA4 to zero to get the alternative model. This gives us 1 df for the difference. Exercise J Specify this model in Mplus and run it. Report on the model fit. Click to show answers See the Mplus input file Excercise J.inp for the model specification in Mplus. Apart from the \\(\\chi^{2}\\)-test of model fit, the model fits well: \\(\\chi^{2} (3) = 27.37\\), with \\(p &lt; .001\\), RMSEA = 0.069, CFI = 0.987, TLI = 0.973, and SRMR = 0.039. Exercise K Compare the two models to each other. What can you conclude? Click to show answers Comparing both models using the \\(\\Delta \\chi^{2}\\)-test gives us \\(27.37  13.29 = 14.0\\) with 1 df such that \\(p &lt; .001\\). This implies that imposing the restriction is not tenable. You can calculate the p-value of the \\(\\Delta \\chi^{2}\\) using the pchisq()-function in R (with the lower.tail argument set to FALSE), or an online tool Comparing the models using information criteria gives us AIC = 29593 and BIC = 29637 for the first model, and AIC = 29605 and BIC = 29643 for the second. In conclusion, all measures indicate the first model is better. However, the current model makes more theoretical sense, and the negative variance estimate in the first model is a problem. For these 2 reasons, we should prefer the current model. Exercise L Can you improve the second model in any way? Indicate which parameter you would add to your model, and what this parameter represents in substantive terms. Click to show answers You can get the modification indices by adding MOD to the OUTPUT command. Here, the suggested BY statements make no sense (later life satisfaction as an indicator of previous life satisfaction). With regards to the ON statement, only the suggested effect of ETA3 ON ETA1 makes sense as we then predict forwards in time. The WITH statement suggests adding a covariance between the residuals of y3 and y4. If we add this covariance and look at the standardized results, we get a correlation. This correlation actually quite high: \\(.522\\) (SE = .044), \\(p &lt; .001\\). Exercise M Run a model in which you include the Y3 WITH Y4 parameter. Where will this relationship end up in the model? Does it lead to a significant improvement? How would you interpret this additional parameter? Click to show answers See Exercise M.inp for the Mplus specification of this model. The Y3 WITH Y4 parameter is an additional covariance between the residuals of y3 and y4 (so not between y3 and y4 themselves). Model fit is quite good (except for the \\(\\chi^{2}\\)-test of model fit): \\(\\chi^{2} (2) = 7.077\\), \\(p = .0291\\), RMSEA = 0.038, CFI = 0.997, TLI = 0.992, and SRMR = 0.011. To compare this model to the previous model, we can do a the \\(\\Delta \\chi^{2}\\)-test: \\(27.37  7.08 = 20.29\\), with 1 df such that \\(p &lt; .001\\), which implies that adding the covariance between the residuals leads to a significant improvement in model fit. This additional parameter implies that y3 and y4 have more in common with each other than what would be expected based on their common dependence on ETA3. Note that in the standardized results, the WITH statement can be interpreted as a correlation, and it is quite high: \\(.522\\) (SE = .044), \\(p &lt; .001\\). "],["ii-clpm-ri-clpm.html", "II CLPM &amp; RI-CLPM", " II CLPM &amp; RI-CLPM For the cross-lagged panel model (CLPM) and the random intercept cross-lagged panel model (RI-CLPM) we are going to analyze data that were reported in Davies, Martin, Coe and Cummings (2016). The summary data (means, standard deviations and correlation matrix) are included in Davies.dat, and contains the means, standard deviations, and the correlation matrix. The number of observations is 232. There are 5 waves of data, taken when the child was 7, 8, 13, 14, and 15 years old. The order of the variables is: Child gender Parental education Interparental hostility (waves 1-5): composite score based on observational data and questionnaires, reflecting the degree of hostility between the parents Interparental dysphoria (waves 1-5): based on composite score based on observational data and questionnaires, reflecting the degree of dysphoria Child/adolescent insecurity in the relationship with the parents (waves 1-5) Psychological problems (waves 1-5): based on the subscales anxious/depressed, withdrawal, aggressive behaviors, and delinquency scales of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), filled out by both parents. Here we will focus on Interparental dysphoria and Psychological problems of the child. The DATA and VARIABLE commands should be: DATA: TYPE = MEANS STDEVIATIONS CORRELATION; FILE = Davies.dat; NOBSERVATIONS = 232; VARIABLE: NAMES = ChildGen ParentEd Hos1 Hos2 Hos3 Hos4 Hos5 Dys1 Dys2 Dys3 Dys4 Dys5 Ins1 Ins2 Ins3 Ins4 Ins5 PsPr1 PsPr2 PsPr3 PsPr4 PsPr5; USEVARIABLES = Dys1-Dys5 PsPr1-PsPr5; Exercise A How many sample statistics are there for this data set (focusing on the 5 measures of dysphoria and the 5 measures of psychological problems? Click to show answers There are 10 observed variables such that there are \\(\\frac{10*11}{2} = 55\\) unique elements in the observed covariance matrix S, and 10 observed means in M. Therefore, there are 55 sample statistics in total. Exercise B We begin with an RI-CLPM (see slide 53). For now, do not impose any constraints on the parameters across time. Draw the model, and indicate which parameters will be estimated freely. How many parameters will be estimated in total? So how many df are there? Click to show answers In the RI-CLPM we estimate: 2 variances for the random intercepts, 1 covariance between the random intercepts, 2 variances for the within-person centered variables at wave 1, 1 covariance between the within-person centered variables at wave 1, 8 residual variances (for the dynamic errors of both variables at wave 2-5), 4 covariances between the residuals (for the dynamics errors at waves 2-5), 16 lagged parameters (4 for each interval), and 10 means. In total, we estimate 44 parameters such that we have \\(65 - 44 = 21\\) df. Exercise C Run the model. Check whether the number of df is correct. Also look at the TECH1 output, to see if you understand where the free parameters are. What is the model fit? Click to show answers The input for this model is in RICLPM.inp. The model means are estimated in the \\(\\nu\\)-matrix, no parameters are estimated in the \\(\\theta\\)-matrix (measurement error variances), \\(\\lambda\\)-matrix (factor loadings), or \\(\\alpha\\)-matrix (means/intercepts of the latent variables). The variances and covariance of the random intercepts, the within-person centered variables at wave 1, and the dynamic errors at subsequent waves are all estimated in the \\(\\psi\\)-matrix. The lagged regression coefficients are estimated in \\(\\beta\\). Apart from the \\(\\chi^{2}\\)-test of model, all fit indices indicate at least acceptable fit. \\(\\chi^{2} (21) = 41.451\\), \\(p = .005\\), RMSEA = 0.065, CFI = 0.979, TLI = 0.956, and SRMR = 0.029. Exercise D Include the significant standardized parameter estimates for the covariances (i.e., the WITH statements) and the lagged regression parameters (i.e., the ON statements) in the figure below. Indicate which part of the model is considered the between-person part, and which part is the within-person part. The bivariate random-intercept cross-lagged panel model with 5 repeated measures (waves). Exercise E Omit the random intercepts. How many parameters and df does this model have? What is the model fit? Click to show answers The input for this model is CLPMasRICLPM.inp. The model has three parameters less (and thus 3 df more) than the previous model: 2 variances and the covariance for the random intercepts. The model fit indices show that this model does not fit well: \\(\\chi^{2} (24) = 73.374\\), \\(p &lt; .001\\), RMSEA = 0.094, CFI = 0.950, TLI = 0.907, and SRMR = 0.061. Exercise F Specify the CLPM and run this model. Compare it to the previous two models. How are these models related? Click to show answers The input for this model is in CLPM.inp. This model is statistically identical to the previous model; these are different parameterizations of the same model. The model fit is therefore also exactly the same. Hence, this model is a special case of the RI-CLPM. Comparing the two models using a chi-square difference test gives: \\(\\Delta \\chi^{2} = 73.37 - 41.45 = 31.92\\) with \\(24  21 = 3\\) df, \\(p &lt; .001\\). Hence, the random intercepts should not be omitted; put differently, there are stable, trait-like difference between families in the two variables (parental dysphoria and psychological problems). However, when constraints are placed on the bound of the parameter space (which is the case here, fixing a variance to 0 is its absolute minimum value), we should actually use the chi-bar-square test (\\(\\bar{\\chi}^{2}\\)-test; Stoel et al. 2006). The traditional \\(\\Delta \\chi^{2}\\)-test does not take into account that variances can only be positive and is therefore conservative. This means that if it is significant, we are certain that the correct test (i.e., the \\(\\bar{\\chi}^{2}\\) test) would also be significant. On the other hand, when the usual chisquare test is not significant, we do not know anything about the result of the correct test (it can be significant or not significant). If you are working in R with the lavaan-package, you can find more information about the \\(\\bar{\\chi}^{2}\\)-test at jeroendmulder.github.io/RI-CLPM/lavaan.html#(bar{chi}^{2})-test. For Mplus users, there is a Shiny app by Rebecca Kuiper available as well. Exercise G Include the significant standardized parameter estimates for the covariances and the lagged regression parameters in the figure below. The bivariate cross-lagged panel model with 5 repeated measures (waves). Exercise H Discuss how the model results differ. Click to show answers Cross-lagged relationships In the RI-CLPM none of the cross-lagged parameters are significant. In contrast, in the CLPM there is a positive relationship from PsPr1 to Dys2. This implies that higher levels of childrens psychological problems at age 7 are followed by higher levels of interparental dysphoria at age 8. Moreover, from age 14 to 15 both cross-lagged parameters are significant and positive, indicating that psychological problems are followed by increases in interparental dysphoria, but also that increased interparental dysphoria is followed by an increase in psychological problems for the adolescent. Autoregressive parameters The autoregressive parameters in the RI-CLPM are lower, and have larger SEs, such that fewer reach significance. This is expected as within-person stability is now captures in the random intercepts, rather than in the autoregressive effects in the CLPM. Correlations In the CLPM only the residual correlation at wave 2 is significant; it is negative, indicating that external effects tend to have an opposite effect on these two processes; increases in Dysphoria are accompanied by decreases in psychological problems and vice versa. In the RI-CLPM, the within-person correlation at wave 1 is not significantly different from zero; however, at waves 2, 3 and 4 the correlations between the residuals is significant and negative. At wave 5 the residual variance is not significant. In the RI-CLPM there is also the correlation between the random intercepts (i.e., the trait-like difference between families). This turns out to be a very substantial correlation of .63: Hence, in contrast to the results from the CLPM and the within-level results from the RI-CLPM, there is a strong positive relationship between trait-like levels of interparental dysphoria and trait-like levels of psychological problems.
