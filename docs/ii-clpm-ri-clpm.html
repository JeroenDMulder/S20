<h2>II CLPM &amp; RI-CLPM</h2>
<p>For the cross-lagged panel model (CLPM) and the random intercept cross-lagged panel model (RI-CLPM) we are going to analyze data that were reported in <a href="10.1017/S0954579416000237">Davies, Martin, Coe and Cummings (2016)</a>. The summary data (means, standard deviations and correlation matrix) are included in Davies.dat, and contains the means, standard deviations, and the correlation matrix. The number of observations is 232. There are 5 waves of data, taken when the child was 7, 8, 13, 14, and 15 years old. The order of the variables is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Child gender</li>
<li>Parental education</li>
<li>Interparental hostility (waves 1-5): composite score based on observational data and questionnaires, reflecting the degree of hostility between the parents</li>
<li>Interparental dysphoria (waves 1-5): based on composite score based on observational data and questionnaires, reflecting the degree of dysphoria</li>
<li>Child/adolescent insecurity in the relationship with the parents (waves 1-5)</li>
<li>Psychological problems (waves 1-5): based on the subscales anxious/depressed, withdrawal, aggressive behaviors, and delinquency scales of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), filled out by both parents.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here we will focus on <em>Interparental dysphoria</em> and <em>Psychological problems</em> of the child. The DATA and VARIABLE commands should be:</p>
<div>
<pre><code>DATA:

<p>There are 10 observed variables such that there are <span class="math inline">\(\frac{10*11}{2} = 55\)</span> unique elements in the observed covariance matrix S, and 10 observed means in M. Therefore, there are 55 sample statistics in total.</p>

<h4>Exercise B</h4>
<p>We begin with an RI-CLPM (see slide 53). For now, do not impose any constraints on the parameters across time. Draw the model, and indicate which parameters will be estimated freely. How many parameters will be estimated in total? So how many <em>df</em> are there?</p>

<p>In the RI-CLPM we estimate:</p>

<li>16 lagged parameters (4 for each interval), and</li>

<p>The input for this model is in <code>RICLPM.inp</code>. The model means are estimated in the <span class="math inline">\(\nu\)</span>-matrix, no parameters are estimated in the <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>-matrix (measurement error variances), <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>-matrix (factor loadings), or <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>-matrix (means/intercepts of the latent variables). The variances and covariance of the random intercepts, the within-person centered variables at wave 1, and the dynamic errors at subsequent waves are all estimated in the <span class="math inline">\(\psi\)</span>-matrix. The lagged regression coefficients are estimated in <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>.</p>
<p>Apart from the <span class="math inline">\(\chi^{2}\)</span>-test of model, all fit indices indicate at least acceptable fit.</p>

<p>The input for this model is <code>CLPMasRICLPM.inp</code>. The model has three parameters less (and thus 3 <em>df</em> more) than the previous model: 2 variances and the covariance for the random intercepts.</p>

<h4>Exercise F</h4>
<p>Specify the CLPM and run this model. Compare it to the previous two models. How are these models related?</p>

</summary>
<p>The input for this model is in <code>CLPM.inp</code>. This model is statistically identical to the previous model; these are different parameterizations of the same model. The model fit is therefore also exactly the same. Hence, this model is a special case of the RI-CLPM.</p>
<p>Comparing the two models using a chi-square difference test gives: <span class="math inline">\(\Delta \chi^{2} = 73.37 - 41.45 = 31.92\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(24 – 21 = 3\)</span> <em>df</em>, <span class="math inline">\(p &lt; .001\)</span>. Hence, the random intercepts should not be omitted; put differently, there are stable, trait-like difference between families in the two variables (parental dysphoria and psychological problems).</p>
<p>However, when constraints are placed on the bound of the parameter space (which is the case here, fixing a variance to 0 is its absolute minimum value), we should actually use the chi-bar-square test (<span class="math inline">\(\bar{\chi}^{2}\)</span>-test; Stoel et al. 2006). The traditional <span class="math inline">\(\Delta \chi^{2}\)</span>-test does not take into account that variances can only be positive and is therefore conservative. This means that if it is significant, we are certain that the correct test (i.e., the <span class="math inline">\(\bar{\chi}^{2}\)</span> test) would also be significant. On the other hand, when the usual chi‐square test is not significant, we do not know anything about the result of the correct test (it can be significant or not significant).</p>
<p>If you are working in R with the lavaan-package, you can find more information about the <span class="math inline">\(\bar{\chi}^{2}\)</span>-test at <a href="https://jeroendmulder.github.io/RI-CLPM/lavaan.html#(bar%7Bchi%7D%5E%7B2%7D)-test">jeroendmulder.github.io/RI-CLPM/lavaan.html#(bar{chi}^{2})-test</a>.

</summary>
<p><strong>Cross-lagged relationships</strong>
In the RI-CLPM none of the cross-lagged parameters are significant. In contrast, in the CLPM there is a positive relationship from PsPr1 to Dys2. This implies that higher levels of children’s psychological problems at age 7 are followed by higher levels of interparental dysphoria at age 8. Moreover, from age 14 to 15 both cross-lagged parameters are significant and positive, indicating that psychological problems are followed by increases in interparental dysphoria, but also that increased interparental dysphoria is followed by an increase in psychological problems for the adolescent.</p>
<p><strong>Autoregressive parameters</strong>
The autoregressive parameters in the RI-CLPM are lower, and have larger SE’s, such that fewer reach significance. This is expected as within-person stability is now captures in the random intercepts, rather than in the autoregressive effects in the CLPM.</p>
<p><strong>Correlations</strong>
In the CLPM only the residual correlation at wave 2 is significant; it is negative, indicating that external effects tend to have an opposite effect on these two processes; increases in Dysphoria are accompanied by decreases in psychological problems and vice versa. In the RI-CLPM, the within-person correlation at wave 1 is not significantly different from zero; however, at waves 2, 3 and 4 the correlations between the residuals is significant and negative. At wave 5 the residual variance is not significant.</p>
<p>In the RI-CLPM there is also the correlation between the random intercepts (i.e., the trait-like difference between families). This turns out to be a very substantial correlation of .63: Hence, in contrast to the results from the CLPM and the within-level results from the RI-CLPM, there is a strong positive relationship between trait-like levels of interparental dysphoria and trait-like levels of psychological problems.</p>
