# Introduction{-}

These course materials are part of the [Introduction to Structural Equation Modeling using Mplus (S20)](https://utrechtsummerschool.nl/courses/social-sciences/introduction-to-structural-equation-modeling-using-mplus) and the [Advanced Course on using Mplus (S23)](https://utrechtsummerschool.nl/courses/social-sciences/advanced-course-on-using-mplus) courses. Both are five-day summer school courses hosted by Utrecht University's department of Methodology and Statistics. The main objective of the introductory course (S20) is to learn how to analyze several models with Mplus (e.g. path models, multiple group models, mediation and moderation, confirmatory factor analysis, and longitudinal models). More in-depth lectures on the fundamentals of Mplus and advanced longitudinal models are discussed in the advanced course (S23). 

Using the menu on the left, you can navigate to exercises of day 4 of S20 and S23.
